                    Primates are believed to have evolved from small, nocturnal, insectivorous mammals. The earliest known primate-like mammals, or
                    proto-primates, evolved in the early Paleocene Epoch, roughly similar to squirrels and tree shrews in size and appearance. The
                    existing fossil evidence is very fragmented, and these proto-primates remain largely mysterious creatures until more fossil
                    evidence is found. The tree shrews and colugos, also known as flying lemurs, are the closest living relatives to primates, and the
                    tree shrew is used as a living model for what the earliest primates, or primate predecessors, might have been like. The
                    evolutionary history of primates can be traced back 57-90 million years, and one of the oldest known primate-like mammal species,
                    Plesiadapis, came from North America. The first true primates were found in North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa in the Eocene
                    Epoch, and these early primates resembled present-day prosimians such as lemurs. By the early Miocene Epoch, apes had evolved from
                    monkeys, and many of the prosimian species became extinct probably as a consequence. Teilhardina brandti, a species found in
                    Wyoming, is as old or older than its Asian and European relatives, upending the prevailing hypothesis that Teilhardina first
                    appeared in China.
